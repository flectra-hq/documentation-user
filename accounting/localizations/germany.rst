German Chart of Accounts
========================

The chart of accounts SKR03 and SKR04 are both supported in Flectra. You can choose the
one you want by going in :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration` then choose the
package you want in the Fiscal Localization section.

Be careful, you can only change the accounting package as long as you have not created any accounting entry.

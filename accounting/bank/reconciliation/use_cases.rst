Use cases
=========

Payments registration
---------------------

We received the payment proof for our invoice of 2100 euros issued to
Johns & Co.

We start at our issued Invoice of 2100 euros for Johns & Co. Because the
sold product is a service we demand an immediate payment. Our accountant
only handles the bank statements at the end of week, so we have to mark
the invoice as paid so we can remember we can start the service with our
customer.

Our customer send us a payment confirmation. We can thus register a
payment and mark the invoice as paid.

By clicking on **register payment,** we are telling Flectra that our
customer paid the Invoice. We thus have to specify the amount and the
payment method

We can always find the payment back from the Invoice by clicking on the
:menuselection:`Info --> Open`.

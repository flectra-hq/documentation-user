Quotations

Here you will find all the quotations sent to you by Flectra. For example, a
quotation can be generated for you after adding an application or a user to your

The *Valid Until* column shows the date through which the quotation is valid; after that date,
the quotation will be "Expired". By clicking on the quotation, you will see all

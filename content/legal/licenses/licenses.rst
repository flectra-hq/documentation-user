Flectra Professional Agreement
==============================

Note

Version 1c - 2021-07-01

By subscribing to the Flectra Professional services (the "Services") provided by FlectraHQ, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, "FlectraHQ, Inc.") in relation with Flectra Professional Edition or Flectra Community Edition (the "Software"), hosted on FlectraHQ, Inc.'s Cloud platforms (the "Cloud Platform") or on-premises ("Self-Hosting"), you (the "Customer") are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions (the "Agreement").

1 Term of the Agreement

The duration of this Agreement (the “Term”) shall be specified in writing on conclusion of this Agreement, beginning on the date of conclusion. It is automatically renewed for an equal Term, unless either party provides a written notice of termination minimum 30 days before the end of the Term to the other party.

2 Definitions

User

Any user account indicated as active in the Software, with access to creation and/or edition mode. Deactivated user accounts and accounts used by external people (or systems) who only have limited access to the Software through the portal facilities (known as "portal Users") are not counted as Users.

App

An "App" is a specialized group of features available for installation in the Software, and listed in the public Pricing section of `FlectraHQ, Inc.'s website. <https://flectrahq.com//>`_

Flectra Partner

An Flectra Partner is a third-party company or individual, chosen by the Customer, and working with the Customer for their Flectra related services. The Customer can decide at any time to work with a different Flectra Partner, or to work with FlectraHQ, Inc. directly (subject to prior notice).

Extra Module

An extra module is a directory of source code files, or a set of Python-based customizations created in a database, that adds features or changes the standard behavior of the Software. It may have been developed by the Customer, by FlectraHQ, Inc., by an Flectra Partner on behalf of the Customer, or by third parties.

Covered Extra Module

A Covered Extra Module is an Extra Module for which the Customer chooses to pay a maintenance fee in order to get support, upgrade and bug fixing services.

Bug

Is considered a Bug any failure of the Software or of a Covered Extra Module that results in a complete stop, error traceback or security breach, and is not directly caused by a defective installation or configuration. Non-compliance with specifications or requirements will be considered as Bugs at the discretion of FlectraHQ, Inc. (typically, when the Software does not produce the results or performance it was designed to produce, or when a country-specific feature does not meet legal accounting requirements anymore).

Covered Versions

Unless specified otherwise, the Services provided under this Agreement are applicable only to the Covered Versions of the Software, which include the 3 most recently released major versions.

3 Access to the Software

The Customer can use the Software hosted on the Cloud Platform, or choose the Self-Hosting option. The Cloud Platform is hosted and fully managed by FlectraHQ, Inc., and accessed remotely by the Customer. With the Self-Hosting option, the Customer instead hosts the Software on computer systems of their choice, that are not under the control of FlectraHQ, Inc..
For the duration of this Agreement, FlectraHQ, Inc. gives the Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use (execute, modify, execute after modification) the Flectra Professional Edition software, under the terms set forth in 9 Appendix A: Flectra Professional Edition License.
The Customer agrees to take all necessary measures to guarantee the unmodified execution of the part of the Software that verifies the validity of the Flectra Professional Edition usage and collects statistics for that purpose, including but not limited to the running of an instance, the number of Users, the installed Apps, and the number of lines of code of Covered Extra Modules.
FlectraHQ, Inc. commits not to disclose individual or named figures to third parties without the consent of the Customer, and to deal with all collected data in compliance with its official Privacy Policy, published at https://www.flectrahq.org/privacy.
Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, this license is revoked immediately and the Customer agrees to stop using the Flectra Professional Edition software and the Cloud Platform.
Should the Customer breach the terms of this section, the Customer agrees to pay FlectraHQ, Inc. an extra fee equal to 300% of the applicable list price for the actual number of Users and installed Apps.

4 Services

4.1 Bug Fixing Service

For the duration of this Agreement, FlectraHQ, Inc. commits to making all reasonable efforts to remedy any Bug of the Software and Covered Extra Modules submitted by the Customer through the appropriate channel (typically, the web form or phone numbers listed on https://discuss.flectrahq.com/ or when working with an Flectra Partner, the channel provided by the partner), and to start handling such Customer submissions within 2 business days.

As soon as the Bug is fixed an appropriate remedy will be communicated to the Customer. If the Customer is using a Covered Version, they will not be asked to upgrade to a more recent Covered Version of the Software as a remedy to a Bug.

When a Bug is fixed in any Covered Version, FlectraHQ, Inc. commits to fixing the Bug in all more recent Covered Versions of the Software.
Both parties acknowledge that as specified in the license of the Software and in the 7.3 Limitation of Liability section of this Agreement, FlectraHQ, Inc. cannot be held liable for Bugs in the Software or in Covered Extra Modules.

4.2 Security Updates Service

Self-Hosting

For the duration of this Agreement, FlectraHQ, Inc. commits to sending a "Security Advisory" to the Customer for any security Bug that is discovered in the Covered Versions of the Software (this excludes Extra Modules), at least 2 weeks before making the Security Advisory public, unless the Bug has already been disclosed publicly by a third party. Security Advisories include a complete description of the Bug, its cause, its possible impacts on the Customer's systems, and the corresponding remedy for each Covered Version.
The Customer understands that the Bug and the information in the Security Advisory must be treated as Confidential Information as described in 6.4 Confidentiality during the embargo period prior to the public disclosure.

Cloud Platform

FlectraHQ, Inc. commits to apply the security remedies for any security Bug discovered in a version of the Software hosted on the Cloud Platform, on all systems under its control, as soon as the remedy is available, without requiring any manual action of the Customer.

4.3 Cloud Hosting Services

For the duration of this Agreement, when the Customer chooses to use the Cloud Platform, FlectraHQ, Inc. commits to providing at least the following services:
Choice of multiple hosting regions (minimum 3: Europe, America, Asia/Pacific)
Hosting in Tier-III data centers or equivalent, with 99.9% network uptime
Grade A SSL (HTTPS) Encryption of communication
Fully automated, verified backups, replicated in multiple regions
Disaster Recovery Plan, tested regularly
The details of the Cloud Hosting Services are described on the Service Level Agreement page at https://flectrahq.com/cloud-sla.

4.4 Support Services

Scope

For the duration of this Agreement, the Customer may open an unlimited number of support tickets free of charge, exclusively for questions regarding Bugs (see 4.1 Bug Fixing Service) or guidance with respect to the use of the standard features of the Software and Covered Extra Modules.
Other assistance requests, such as questions related to development or customizations may be covered through the purchase of a separate service agreement. In case it’s not clear if a request is covered by this Agreement, the decision is at the discretion of FlectraHQ, Inc..

Availability

Tickets can be submitted via the web form or phone numbers listed on https://discuss.flectrahq.com/ or when working with an Flectra Partner, the channel provided by the partner, subject to local opening hours.

4.5 Working with an Flectra Partner

For bug fixes, support and upgrade services, the Customer may either work with an Flectra Partner as the main point of contact, or work with FlectraHQ, Inc. directly.
If the Customer decides to work with an Flectra Partner, FlectraHQ, Inc. will subcontract services related to the Covered Extra Modules to the Flectra Partner, who becomes the main point of contact of the customer. The Flectra Partner may contact FlectraHQ, Inc. on behalf of the customer for second-level assistance with regard to standard features of the Software.
If the Customer decides to work with FlectraHQ, Inc. directly, services related to Covered Extra Modules are provided if and only if the Customer is hosted on the Flectra Cloud Platform.

5 Charges and Fees

5.1 Standard charges

The standard charges for the Flectra Professional subscription and the Services are based on the number of Users and the installed Apps used by the Customer, and specified in writing at the conclusion of the Agreement.
When during the Term, the Customer has more Users or more installed Apps than specified at the time of conclusion of this Agreement, the Customer agrees to pay an extra fee equivalent to the applicable list price (at the beginning of the Term) for the additional Users or Apps, for the remainder of the Term.
In addition, services for Covered Extra Modules are charged based on the number of lines of code in these modules. When the Customer opts for the maintenance of Covered Extra Modules, the charge is a monthly fee of 20$ per 100 lines of code (rounded up to the next hundred), unless otherwise specified in writing at the conclusion of the Agreement. Lines of code will be counted with the cloc command of the Software, and include all text lines in the source code of those modules, regardless of the programming language (Python, Javascript, XML, etc.), excluding blank lines, comment lines and files that are not loaded when installing or executing the Software.
When the Customer requests an upgrade, for each Covered Extra Module that has not been covered by a maintenance fee for the last 12 months, FlectraHQ, Inc. may charge a one-time extra fee of 20$ per 100 lines of code, for each missing month of coverage.

5.2 Renewal charges

Upon renewal as covered in section 1 Term of the Agreement, if the charges applied during the previous Term (excluding any “Initial User Discounts”) are lower than the most current applicable list price, these charges will increase by up to 7%.

5.3 Taxes

All fees and charges are exclusive of all applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental taxes, fees or charges (collectively, "Taxes"). The Customer is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with purchases made by the Customer under this Agreement, except when FlectraHQ, Inc. is legally obliged to pay or collect Taxes for which the Customer is responsible.

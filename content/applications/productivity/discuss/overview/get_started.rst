Get Started with Discuss
========================

Discuss allows you to bring all of your company’s communication together through messages, notes,
and chat. Share information, projects, files, prioritize tasks, and stay connected with colleagues
and partners throughout applications. Forge better relationships, increase productivity and
transparency by promoting a convenient way of communicating.

Choose your notifications preference
====================================

Access your *Preferences* and choose how you would like your notifications to be handled.

| By default, the field is set as *Handle by Emails* making messages, notes, and notifications where
  you were mentioned or that you follow, to be sent through email. By choosing *Handle in Flectra*,
  they are shown in the *Inbox*.
| Messages can then be *Marked as Todo*, *Replied*, or *Marked as Read*.


The messages tagged as *Mark as Todo* are also shown in *Starred*, while the ones *Marked as Read*
are moved to *History*.

Start Chatting
==============

The first time you log in to your account, FlectraBot sends you a message asking for permission to
receive desktop notifications to chats. If accepted, you receive push notifications to the messages
sent to you despite of where you are in Flectra.

sidebar and on the *Messaging menu*.

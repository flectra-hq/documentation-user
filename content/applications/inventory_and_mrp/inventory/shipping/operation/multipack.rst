Overview

By default, Flectra considers that your delivery is composed of one
package. But you can easily ship your deliveries with more than one
package. It is fully integrated with the third-party shippers.

Configuration
=============

To configure the use of packages, go to the menu
:menuselection:`Inventory --> Configuration --> Settings`. 
Locate the **Packages** section and tick **Record
packages used on packing: pallets, boxes,...**
